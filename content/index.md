Hi! I'm Steven Smith. This is my website and digital notes garden where I hope to catalog the things that interest me as well as some of the things I've learned and solutions I've come across.

I've enabled comments on most of these pages so if you learned something from any of my notes or think I can do something better please comment!

My site is divided into three main categories:
- [[Thoughts/|Thoughts/]] - These are blog style posts that discuss what I'm thinking and what I want to be doing. They're the least formal of any of my pages.
- [[Notes/|Notes/]] - These are less polished pages. They're meant to hold small tidbits of information that I constantly return to or want to make sure I remember.
- [[Guides/|Guides/]]  - Theses are the more polished notes. They cover a topic from start to finish and are me trying to explain what I've learned for others and also write them down in a way that reinforces the learning for myself.

If you're curious about this site and how I've set it up. I've tagged all of those pages with [[./tags/meta|meta]]. 

Thanks for being a part of my public learning journey!
